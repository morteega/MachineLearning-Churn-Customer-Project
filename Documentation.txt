Since it is a binary resolution, the best way to approach the project is by using random forest as the Model Building
Random Forest allows you to know which vairables are the ones affecting on the Churn result, also because it is very robust and has a huge capability
of managing different type of data 
Random Forest consits on multiple decision trees in which every single one of them will get different data from the same variable, each
tree giving a decision (Yes/No). After all the trees are done deciding, the decision with the most trees with it will be the decision
the Model takes as valid.


In DataLoader, the method load_data the varaible TotalCharges has to be transformed into numeric because pandas by itself treats it as an object,
and we manually have to transform it into numeric data
